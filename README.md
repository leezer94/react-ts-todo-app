# Why should i Use Redux

Redux helps you manage "global" state

- You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
- The app state is updated frequently over time
- The logic to update that state may be complex
- The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people

## Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is our recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

## This is a small example of "one-way data flow":

State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time
The UI is rendered based on that state
When something happens (such as a user clicking a button), the state is updated based on what occurred
The UI re-renders based on the new state

One way to solve this is to extract the shared state from the components, and put it into a centralized location outside the component tree. With this, our component tree becomes a big "view", and any component can access the state or trigger actions, no matter where they are in the tree!

By defining and separating the concepts involved in state management and enforcing rules that maintain independence between views and states, we give our code more structure and maintainability.

### Action ( Action === event type)

An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a type field. You can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application.

###Â Payload

An action object can have other fields with additional information about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field called payload.

### Action Creators

An action creator is a function that creates and returns an action object. We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time:

### Reducers

A reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state: (state, action) => newState. `You can think of a reducer as an event listener which handles events based on the received action (event) type.`

### Store

The current Redux application state lives in an object called the store .

`The store is created by passing in a reducer, and has a method called getState that returns the current state value:`

### Dispatch

The Redux store has a method called dispatch. `The only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object.` The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside, and we can call getState() to retrieve the updated value:
`You can think of dispatching actions as "triggering an event"`

### Selectors

Selectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data:
